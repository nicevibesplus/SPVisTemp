# SPVisTemp: Visualization of Climate-Induced Urban Temperature Rise

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work for the **"Study Project"** module focused on the visualization of temperature increases in cities (and rural regions) driven by climate change. The project aims to develop effective visual tools and techniques to represent temperature trends over time, emphasizing the impact of global warming on urban environments.

## Goals
- **Data Collection**: Gather climate data relevant to temperature trends in various cities.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify patterns and correlations related to climate change.
- **Visualization**: Create clear and impactful visualizations that illustrate the temperature rise due to climate change.
